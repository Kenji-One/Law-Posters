        Federal Law Posters
      </h2>
      <p class="u-grey-text u-margin-bottom-smallest-3">
        All businesses are required to post federal labor law posters in a
        workplace common area frequented by employees and applicants. The
        posting requirement for each individual federal labor law poster is
        required by the Federal government. Failure to abide by posting
        requirements places an employer at risk, and may lead to employee
        disputes among other complications, including costly fines and
        penalties.
        <br /><br />
        It is highly recommended to post the federal laws in a Spanish version
        if 5% or more of your workforce speaks Spanish as a primary language. In
        some states, itâ€™s a mandatory requirement. For your convenience, we
        provide two poster options to help satisfy your federal posting
        requirements. These include: Our Federal Labor Law Poster, which is
        available in English or Spanish, and our Bilingual Federal Labor Law
        Poster, which includes postings in both English and Spanish.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to the federal labor law posting requirements, federal
        contractors and their subcontractors have separate posting requirements
        that must be met as well. To offer a convenient option for contractors
        and subcontractors of the federal government, we combined the most
        highly required postings on our Federal Contractors Edition Poster. This
        poster is also available in both English and Spanish.

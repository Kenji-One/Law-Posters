      <div class="u-grey-text">
        With federal contracting opportunities come a host of compliance
        requirements companies must be aware of. These laws are mandated by the
        Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). Divisions of
        companies and subcontractors are many times subject to the same
        compliance requirements imposed upon direct contractors. Likewise,
        subcontractors and other divisions of a company oftentimes need to
        implement Affirmative Action Plans (APP).
        <br /><br />
        The LaborLawCenterâ„¢ understands the questions and concerns that may
        arise as a result of your contracting compliance regulations. For your
        convenience, we provide the resources, products, and FAQ below to
        address your questions on your most complex contracting and
        subcontracting scenarios. All of our Federal Contractor products have
        been updated to reflect 2021 compliance requirements.
